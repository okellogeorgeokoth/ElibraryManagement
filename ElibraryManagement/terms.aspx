        <p class="text-center">We’re updating our Terms of Service, Payments Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Host Damage Protection Terms, and some of our other terms and policies (“Terms”).

The updated Terms will go into effect for existing users on April 22, 2022. Beginning on that date, you will need to agree to the updated Terms in order to book or manage reservations. Also, your use of the Airbnb Platform from that date onward will be automatically subject to the updated Privacy Policy.

We’ve also put up information about how terms and policies are changing on our Terms update page. You should review the updated Terms in full and can download hard copies for your reference. If you disagree with the updated Terms, you may terminate your agreement with Airbnb at any time by deleting your account.

Thank you for being a member of our community.</p>
